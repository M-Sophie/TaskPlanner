# TaskPlanner
Program walkthrough
This program holds two Windows Forms.

1- The first is called MainForm. It opens when the program starts. 

It contains the following elements:
General menu strip, containing

Copy (Ctrl + C), not yet implemented but would allow copying a task

Paste (Ctrl + V), not yet implemented but would allow pasting of a copied task
Cut (Ctrl + X), not yet implemented but would allow copying and deleting a task
Undo (Ctrl + Z), not yet implemented but would allow undoing the last action(s)
File menu strip, containing

Save (Ctrl + S), not yet implemented but would allow saving a list
New (Ctrl + N), . which opens a new MainForm, which is blank, for a new list
Export as SVG (Ctrl + P), not yet implemented but would allow saving a list as SVG
Close (Ctrl + Q), which closes the program without saving
A blank space, which will be filled with up to 10 tasks as they are added by the user. These tasks hold a box on their right, which can be selected for deletion (and, eventually, for viewing)


Clear button (Alt + C), which removes all tasks from view and allows for a fresh start
Delete button (Alt + D), which removes all selected tasks, leaving a blank space in its place, which can be refilled with a new task

View button (Alt + V), which is not currently abled, but would allow to view and modify the details of a selected task once implemented
Add button (Alt + A), which is discussed below. Note that, once the screen is full (10 tasks are displayed), a MessageBox will be displayed and the following NewTask Windows Form will not open

The second is called NewTask. It opens when the user selects the Add button. 

It contains the following elements:
Textbox on the righthand side of the word “Task”, which can be filled by the user
	
Save button (Alt + S), which will save the entered text as a new task, if not blank, and open a MessageBox to confirm successful saving before closing the NewTask window and reopening the MainForm one

Cancel button (Alt + C), which will close the NewTask window and reopening the MainForm one
